# Crime-Prediction-AI-Model

The Crime prediction AI Model, is a classification AI Model. 

The AI Model takes certain, Crime relevant attributes and classifies weather a Crime will occur or not and the probability of the crime occurring. 

Data Cleaning and Preprcoessing: 

- Handled null values, duplicates, Outliers. - Performed label encoding on Categorical Values.
- Performed Z-score normalisation on numerical Values. 
- Performed Feature Engineering for complex features in the dataset such as Date and Block Name and Number. 

Modeling: 
This Project Supports multiple models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, Decision Trees, KNN, logistic Regression, SVM, Cat Boost. 

The Project features a user friendly GUI which allows user to enter the data and choose the preferred model and the crime occurance will be predicted as well as the probability of it
